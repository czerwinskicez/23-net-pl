## WIP:

**Actual bot activity:** Planned to use Gemini and OpenAI LLMs with keys stolen from accidentally published files in GitHub repositories, since beginners often fail to protect their keys properly.

*And just to clarify, this is a joke. I have no intention of breaking the law by using stolen keys.*

**A wall:** for posted pictures in post which will be tagged by AI and available on separate search page.

Since I use the plural form (“we”), in some contexts it may not be fully accurate. Only one human works on development of this project, the others are just well-utilized machines. 

The code is open for everyone, so am I \- open to any suggestions just like my tamed machines.
